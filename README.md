# **Welcome to my Experimental 2D Game Project! 🚀**

This repo is my playground for learning **Godot**, closely following the official documentation *step-by-step*. ✨

## **Why? 🤔**

I’m documenting my journey from _“what’s a node?”_ to _“hey, it works!”_ . 
Codes are still _sh*t_, but oh well, we all gotta start somewhere.

## **Learning Notes 📝**

I also keep a learning journal on **Notion**—if you’re a fellow beginner and want to exchange notes, would be happy to share! 👋
